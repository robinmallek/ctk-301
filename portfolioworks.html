<h2> Visual Works </h2>

<img src="miriodrawing.jpg" alt="drawing in pen of a double page spread of mirio from my hero academia">
<p> Shown to the left are some drawings/tracings I have done over the years while I became more invested in anime/animation/keyframes. The top left is of Zoro from One Piece, with the right two top to bottom being Eri and Mirio from My Hero Acadamia respectively. </p>
<img src="asadrawing.jpg" alt="drawing of asa mitaka from chainsaw man dressed as fiona from adventure time">
<p> Another drawing by hand I've done was from last semester in one of my preliminary CTK courses, where we were tasked to emulate a piece of art with another, and I chose to draw one of my favorite characters in manga, Asa Mitaka, as Fiona from Adventure time! </p>

<p> For my Sound Design and Recording and Sampling classes this semester, I was tasked with taking any clip of animation and making a completely new sound folder for it that matches the content. Not only did I record about 50% of the sounds myself through various means of foley, I also did some of the voice work for this project! Overall this project is a bit of both categories, but the visual aspect is a huge part of it, showing the scene I tried to recreate with the sounds I collected. </p>

<p> For a Video editing class I took in the fall semester of 2024, we were tasked with creating a short film/video using all the techniques we earned throughout that semester, with the video "drive" being my final product! </p>
